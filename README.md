# omic_workflow
Omic data-agnostic analysis and machine learning workflow for the exploratory analysis of the data and the generation of a supervised machine learning model for binary classification (based on sample types).

Reflective script generated containing the processing and analysis steps for the workflow used throughout the project involving the analysis of metabolomic datasets from rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease cohorts. 

New data should be in format similar to that shown for the example dataset generated in the script. 

Comments and questions should be directed to cameron.best@glasgow.ac.uk
